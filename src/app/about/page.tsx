          <p>
            I taught myself to code in 2020 with a course I took after work.
            Five years later I write software a bank depends on, and I
            co-founded a company that ships to the App Store. The work is the
            same either way, take something complicated and make it feel simple
            to use.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of what I build is private. A white-label banking platform on
            one side, a company still shipping on the other. What I can show
            lives on the work page.
